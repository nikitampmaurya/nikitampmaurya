ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, welcome to my GitHub
I will be completing an MSc in Bioinformatics at the University of Liverpool this Sept 2025.
Currently, I am looking for entry-level jobs such as Computational Biologist and Bioinformatician in the UK/Europe.
On my GitHub, you will find data analysis projects using R, Python, and Linux commands.
